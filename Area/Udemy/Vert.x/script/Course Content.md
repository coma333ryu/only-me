Hello and welcome to the Vertex course.

Before we get started, I would like to give you a brief overview of the course content.

After the introduction, we will start the course with the vertex course section.

This is the most important section of all and is mandatory to understand how Vertex works.

The course section will give you an understanding about the actor model of Vertex, which is called Vertex.

Then you will learn what an event loop is, how to interact with the event bus and how to use Vertex Promise and future classes, which are very important for the asynchronous code handling.

After the core section, we will dive deeper into the vertex web module, which is covering Http, routingand everything you need to operate a web server.

We will also look into the reactive web client in case you are calling other microservices as when deploying an application to multiple environments like a test environment and production, a proper configuration is needed.

We will look into ways how to configure vertex application using environment variables and a Yaml configuration file.

The majority of software applications interact with databases in the vertex data section.

We will learn how to use the reactive SQL clients and the SQL Template module.

We will interact with the PostgreSQL and MySQL database and to configure a database schema, we will see how flyway can be used after the vertex data section.

We will have a lot knowledge already, but there are some more advanced sections like the vertex reactive section which will cover the usage of Mutiny, which is a reactive library.

Following up, we will look into the Quarkus reactive library.

Quarkus is a modern cloud native Java framework, which is using Vertex under the hood, so we will dive into it and see how the power of vertex can be utilized when data needs to be pushed to clients.

WebSockets are very popular, so we will see how to build a websocket server and a websocket client using Vertex.

During the course we will create multiple applications and by following the hands on lectures you should be able to build awesome reactive applications yourself.
